## Living in London

Most of tech companies and startups are based in East London (Shoreditch and around Old Street - the [Silicon Roundabout][roundabout]).
If you're a meetup/hackhaton/conferences kind of person that's where you want to live.
You might also choose to live in Hoxton or Haggerston, as long as you're close to the Overground it's easy to commute.



West London can be cheaper than East nowdays. The Central line is usually fast but 
busy during office hours. A typical commute time from West London to East London could take up to 30 mins. 
Use the [Transports for London][tfl]  or [City Mapper][city-mapper] to find out more about commuting time.

**East London**:  Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Dalston Kingsland, Hackney - The are tons of bars and clubs in 
the area. If you work around the "Silicon Roundabout" it could be the most obvious choice to live there. 
Note that it could be noisy in certain streets (lots of partygoers).

**West London**: Hammersmith and Fullham, Shepherd's Bush, Notthing Hill - West London tends to be 
slightly cheaper than East London and more residential (basically there are not enough cool pubs/bars/cafe!).

**South London** - Brixton, Southwark and Borough - The area has lots to offer in terms of cafes, 
restaurants and night life. There are also great markets ([Brixton Market][brixton-market] and 
[Borough Market][borough-market]).

## Find accomodation in London

Finding good accomodation in London can be stressful. Keep it mind it's not an easy task! 
Here's where to start looking:

* [Open Rent][open-rent] (London Startup!) 
* [Zoopla][zoopla] 
* [Right Move][right-move]

[open-rent]: https://www.openrent.co.uk/
[zoopla]: http://www.zoopla.co.uk/
[right-move]: http://www.rightmove.co.uk/

**Note**: Some online offers might be already gone before you can even click on them! Most of the offers
will be from Letting Agents. 

**Hacker approach:**

* Use the websites above to find out the price of the area.
* Note of the name of the letting agents covering that area.
* Go to the Agency in person. You will find out about new properties before they'll start advertising online.
* Double check if the aparment you've found is still available (**phone** the agency).
* Be patient. It could take a couple of weeks before you find something nice. 
* Be fast. If you like it, tell the agents you want to take it. Note: typically you'll have to give a deposit.
* **Pro tips** If you set an appointment with an agent, call them on the phone a couple of
hours before the meeting. Letting agents *tend to forget* to call you back if the property is already gone.
You'll spare a trip and save time.

I haven't dealt with private landlords that much, I think it's a bit more risky (it depends
on the landlord) but for if you feel brave you can always have a look at [Gumtree][gumtree] (it's the local CraigsList) 
and you might actually find a good deal.

## Looking for Work


* [Hacker Jobs][hacker-jobs] A good recruiter free job board run by [Steve (Peroni on HN)][peroni]
* [Work in Startups][work-in-startups] Mainly startup based (it has a co-founders section).
* [3 Beards Jobs][3-beards-jobs] Startups, digital agencies and established companies advertising their openings.
* [Silicon Milk Roudabout][silicon-milk-roundabout] A really big job fair in London.


**Hacker approach**: Job boards are ok. A better approach is to join some developers mailing lists. 
Look for your favourite programming language meetup and group. Searching for "[language] User Group London" 
on Google will do the trick.

You might also be proactive and check yourself the available openings. It requires a bit of manual work 
(you'll have to find the companies and their hiring/jobs page). Few useful websites:

* [Roundabout.io][roundabout] (I'm the maintainer) 
* [Built in london][builtinlondon]
* [Silicon Milk Roundabout Companies][silicon-milk-roundabout]
